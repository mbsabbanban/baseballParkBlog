The Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field

Hi loyal readers. This is Part II of my "Day at the Ball Park" series. One of my life goals is to go to each ball park in the United States and to take in everything baseball for each of the different baseball stadiums. I know, I know, it's a bit cliche (like this list of sports cliches) but hey, you gotta admit that it is a really cool hobby. At the very least, it gives me a good excuse to travel around the country and take in the sights and sounds of the US of A. 

Why baseball over football or basketball? Not to diss the other major sports (I am an avid Knicks fan) but nothing screams "AMERICA" more than baseball. Well, maybe bald eagles and cherry pies but I hear that is a difficult hobby to get into. The thing I love most about baseball parks is that they're so noticeably different from each other, each arena with it's own advantages and disadvantages. They are a microcosm of each region, an excellent indication of local cuisine, local etiquette, and most importantly, the local fan culture. Each organization takes these differences and make it their own, making for a unique experience for players and fans alike.

For those of you that didn't read (I strongly recommend that you do) my previous ball park post on the Oakland Athletics, I dabbled with a rating system and tried to explain my time at the O.co Coliseum in a concise and hopefully informational manner. I've decided to continue with the format that I laid out in my first entry and will do my best to add more substance to it, depending on how my readers react. I plan to include more pictures, more park history, more team culture, and more of my spot-on analysis (just kidding, my misinformed opinions) in each of the sections that I'm writing about.

This time around, I decided to visit Sunny Florida to watch one of baseball's most under appreciated teams -- The Tampa Bay Rays. Of course, I had other reasons to visit Tampa (family, casino, beach) but I'm going to be honest, I was extremely excited to watch a game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Boston Red Sox at one of the "crappiest" parks in the MLB. I'm sure some of you are scratching your heads and thinking, "REALLY?!? THE TAMPA BAY RAYS!?!? LOLOLOL"

Yep. That's what I mean by under appreciated. The Tampa Bay Rays and the park that they play at, Tropicana Field, have a reputation for being an overall crappy experience. No crowds. Terrible baseball team. Dysfunctional Stadium. The list can go on and on and on. Well... Let me just say one thing. My time at the Trop was one of the most pleasant surprises that I've had in a while. Yup, you heard me right. The Rays game that I went to was actually very entertaining. It was also a piece of history as it was the last match where aces Jon Lester (of the Boston Red Sox) and David Price (of the TB Rays) played for their respective teams before 2014's CRAZY trade deadline.

So let's kick it off. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce you to the TAMPA BAY RAYS and TROPICANA FIELD.

The Tampa Bay Rays.

One of the youngest franchises in MLB history, Tampa's foray into professional baseball started off in 1998 as an expansion team under the moniker, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Similar to all of the other expansion teams in the late 90s, the origin story of the Rays is filled with enough intrigue and back room dealings to make for a rather crappy baseball movie or maybe even a mediocre political drama (sorry folks, no MONEYBALL here). That being said, I figure I'll save you all the trouble and won't get into the nitty gritty. For those of you that are interested, I recommend reading "The Extra 2%" by Jonah Keri as he does a great job covering the city of St. Petersburg's efforts to obtain a baseball team. 

Since most of my readers are too lazy to read my entire review, let alone a whole book about the history of the Rays, I'll go ahead and cut to the chase. The short version is that Tampa got burned multiple times in their effort to finally bring an MLB team to the city. When they finally got their wish, the organization ended up in the AL East, one of the most historic and competitive divisions in baseball. Between the Yankees and the Red Sox, who has time to root for the Tampa Bay Rays? Despite these setbacks, the leadership of General Manager Andrew Friedman, President Matthew Silverman, and Manager Joe Maddon, the Rays were able to make a name for themselves in 2008 and 2010, winning the Division titles with one of the smallest pay checks in MLB history. 

Fast forward to 2014. Fortune seems to be turning their back on the Tampa Bay Rays as they aren't exactly the hottest team in the AL East. Their current record stands at 57-59 so they're close to being a .500 team (and yes, I know that they're better than the Mets but that's besides the point). The Ray's top hitters (Longoria, Zobrist) are struggling and they just let go off their ace pitcher. Yet amidst all these woes, the product on the field is still enjoyable and at times, inspirational. You see, Silverman and Friedman subscribe to a very similar MONEYBALL approach that Sandy Alderson is practicing. Using techniques that only former Wall Street bankers could've thought of, the Rays organization has assembled a pretty decent product with a Moneyball-esque salary.

Yes, ladies and gentleman, the Rays are trying to get the most bang for their buck. Keep all of this in mind as I step into Tropicana Field.

PARK AESTHETICS 5/10 - NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

Tropicana Field (or the Thunderdome as it was originally called) was constructed in 1990 as part of the city's first effort to bring Major League Baseball to the area. In their initial bid to entice the Chicago White Sox to become the TAMPA BAY White Sox, the city went all out to build the latest and greatest state-of-the-art sports facility, complete with domed-rooftop (to counteract the frequent Florida thunderstorms) and AstroTurf. At the time, this was a major investment, especially since there was no guarantee that the city was going to get a sports team.

Unfortunately the initial bid to bring baseball to Pinellas county fell flat on it's face. Not to worry though! The town of St. Petersberg tried again in 1993 in an effort to get an MLB expansion team, although this effort was also thwarted with the decision to bring baseball to Miami and Denver instead of Tampa Bay. It wasn't until 1997 that the MLB organization approved to bring an expansion team over, and then it wasn't until 1998 that the Devil Rays played their first regular season game against the Detroit Tigers. That means that for close to a decade, the park was unused by ANY sports team and that by the time baseball was officially introduced to Tampa, the "state-of-the-art" facilities were more like "third-world=country" than anything else.

Luckily my trip to "The Trop" (as it's affectionately called) wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be. Apparently before the 2007 season, the park underwent some much needed renovations and they redid the interior and exterior, big time. So, instead of being greeted by a run-down, lopsided, white monstrosity, I first laid eyes upon a not-so-run-down, lopsided, white baseball park. Okay, not so bad, I thought.

Actually, the white color and the structure of the park itself isn't too bad. I can understand having a domed stadium, especially since summers in Florida can be hot and humid (so a bad time for the crowds), not to mention the frequent storms that roll in every couple of hours. From a design stand point, you can definitely see the park from miles away when you're driving on the highway toward the game. When I say miles away, I also mention this as a legitimate complaint that I have against the park. It is simply too far from the major metropolitan areas. The Trop is situated on a peninsula between Tampa and St. Pete. Unfortunately, this location makes getting to the games a big hassle, with all the traffic getting into and out of the parking lot. This particular trip made me appreciate games in the Northeast even more. Due to robust and reliable transportation systems of the Northeast (seriously, not a joke), it's fairly simple to get to a ball game without having to deal with any traffic along the way.

Anyways, the exterior wasn't terrible and as I walked towards the main entrance, you could see that the ticketing office and the front portion of the park had been painted with a nice and refreshing light blue color. The colorful "Tropicana Field" sign seemed much more welcoming than, say, the front entrance of Yankee Stadium or the concrete tomb that is the Oakland Coliseum. Stepping through the doors you ended up walking into a surprising Rotunda, another architectural splendor that you can't tell from the outside. Although not nearly as nice as the Jackie Robinson Rotunda back in Citifield, the colorful displays of all the star players when you first walk in is magnificent and quite spacious. To the right of the entrance is the Team Shop where I was able to buy my Rays hat as part of my collection. I have to say that it was even more crowded than what I'm used to in Citfield, probably because the Red Sox were in town and apparently that always draws the big crowds to the stadium.

Walking around the stadium had sort of a shopping mall feel (something I'll go into later) but for now, the seats that I was sitting at was the left field, 300 level section (which is equivalent to the 400 level section in Citifield). Not the greatest seats but still good enough to see the field and the entire park. There were some tarps on the highest level (I guess it would be the 500 section) but I'm guessing that they only open them up for play-off season (?). The only complaint that I do have is that it took a while for me to find my seats. There is a distinct lack of maps, stairways, and elevators that I ended up walking through various sections of the ball park. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing because I ended up walking through the VIP club section, which was a real treat.

Getting into the baseball specifics, right away you could tell the field was very different from your normal outdoor ball parks. Because of the domed roof, the team opts to use astroturf instead of grass. Aesthetically... it looks pretty ugly. You can see weird discoloration streaks throughout the field. There is "sand" in the infield (or at least I think that it's sand or dirt) but the contrast is incredibly great against the astroturf field. When you look up towards the domed roof, you also notice something peculiar to the Trop. That's right, I'm talking about the circles of catwalks at the top. For lighting purposes, there are 3 rings of catwalks that kind of hang from the roof. So that's the practical function of these catwalks. The other functions you might be asking? Well, it's not difficult to imagine that pop flies actually hit the catwalks and affect the trajectory of the ball.

The dimensions of the ball park going from left field to right: 315 ft - 370 ft - 410 ft - 404 ft - 404 ft - 370 ft - 322 ft. Some of the fences are actually further than Citifield (410 as opposed to 408 ft) however there are no weird shapes with the way the fences are laid out. Although ESPN ranks the Trop as a "hitters" friendly park, all the other sources that I've read, from the Bill James website (http://www.billjamesonline.com/the_best_and_worst_hitters_parks/) actually designates it as a Pitcher Friendly park. I'm honestly not too sure whether it is a hitters or pitchers park. What I do know, however, is that because it is a domed stadium, there are no wind factors to take into account. The Pitching and the Hitting that you see in the field is as real as it gets. 

Overall I would say that the Trop as a facility isn't bad. The feeling and the atmosphere is much different from more "traditional/neo-modern" ball parks that I've been to. I guess it's not really my cup of tea but the astroturf and the dome and the catwalks really don't do it for me. It seems very... artificial. That being said, the stories of the park not being well-kept is complete BS. I think that the management AND the fans really care about the park and with the latest renovations, they have a facility that is good enough to host some great baseball.

To sum it up: The Trop is way better than I expected... not really a garbage dump

PARK AMENITIES 7/10

From the Rotunda, the park splits into shopping mall-like corridors with stores, bars, and restaurants lining the walls.
