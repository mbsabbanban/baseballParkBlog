The Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field

Hi loyal readers. This is Part II of my "Day at the Ball Park" series. One of my life goals is to go to each ball park in the United States and to take in everything baseball for each of the different baseball stadiums. I know, I know, it's a cliched goal but hey, you gotta admit that it is a really cool hobby. The thing about baseball parks is that they're so different from other sporting arenas in the United States. Sports such as football go out of their way to make the playing field as even as possible. This philosophy carries over to the arena itself. Well, this isn't the case for baseball. On the contrary, one of the coolest things about baseball is that the game relishes on the differences between each of the different parks. As a baseball fan, the food, the park atmosphere, and the team culture make each park an incredibly different experience. This isn't even taking into account the product on the field or even the differences in stadium dimensions, etc.

For those of you that didn't read (I strongly recommend that you do), my previous baseball park entry was about the Oakland Athletics and my time at the O.co Coliseum to watch the hottest team in baseball. I've decided to continue with the format that I laid out in my first entry and will probably add more substance to it, depending on how my readers react. I plan to include more pictures, more park history, more team culture, and more of my spot-on analysis (just kidding, my misinformed opinions) in each of the sections that I'm writing about.

This time around, I decided to visit Sunny Florida to watch one of baseball's most under appreciated teams -- The Tampa Bay Rays. Of course, I had other reasons to visit Tampa (family, casino, beach) but I'm going to be honest, I was extremely excited to watch a game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Boston Red Sox at one of the "crappiest" parks in the MLB. I'm sure some of you are scratching your heads and thinking, "REALLY?!? THE TAMPA BAY RAYS!?!? LOLOLOL"

Yep. That's what I mean by under appreciated. The Tampa Bay Rays and the park that they play at, Tropicana Field, have a reputation for being an overall crappy experience. No crowds. Terrible baseball team. Dysfunctional Stadium. The list can go on and on and on. Well... Let me just say one thing. My time at the Trop was one of the most pleasant surprises that I've had in a while. Yup, you heard me right. The Rays game that I went to was actually very entertaining.

So let's kick it off. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce you to the TAMPA BAY RAYS and TROPICANA FIELD.
