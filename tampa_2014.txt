The Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field

Hi loyal readers. This is Part II of my "Day at the Ball Park" series. One of my life goals is to go to each ball park in the United States and to take in everything baseball for each of the different baseball stadiums. I know, I know, it's a bit cliche (like this list of sports cliches) but hey, you gotta admit that it is a really cool hobby. At the very least, it gives me a good excuse to travel around the country and take in the sights and sounds of the US of A. 

Why baseball over football or basketball? Not to diss the other major sports (I am an avid Knicks fan) but nothing screams "AMERICA" more than baseball. Well, maybe bald eagles and cherry pies but I hear that is a difficult hobby to get into. The thing I love most about baseball parks is that they're so noticeably different from each other, each arena with it's own advantages and disadvantages. They are a microcosm of each region, an excellent indication of local cuisine, local etiquette, and most importantly, the local fan culture. Each organization takes these differences and make it their own, making for a unique experience for players and fans alike.

For those of you that didn't read (I strongly recommend that you do) my previous ball park post on the Oakland Athletics, I dabbled with a rating system and tried to explain my time at the O.co Coliseum in a concise and hopefully informational manner. I've decided to continue with the format that I laid out in my first entry and will do my best to add more substance to it, depending on how my readers react. I plan to include more pictures, more park history, more team culture, and more of my spot-on analysis (just kidding, my misinformed opinions) in each of the sections that I'm writing about.

This time around, I decided to visit Sunny Florida to watch one of baseball's most under appreciated teams -- The Tampa Bay Rays. Of course, I had other reasons to visit Tampa (family, casino, beach) but I'm going to be honest, I was extremely excited to watch a game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Boston Red Sox at one of the "crappiest" parks in the MLB. I'm sure some of you are scratching your heads and thinking, "REALLY?!? THE TAMPA BAY RAYS!?!? LOLOLOL"

Yep. That's what I mean by under appreciated. The Tampa Bay Rays and the park that they play at, Tropicana Field, have a reputation for being an overall crappy experience. No crowds. Terrible baseball team. Dysfunctional Stadium. The list can go on and on and on. Well... Let me just say one thing. My time at the Trop was one of the most pleasant surprises that I've had in a while. Yup, you heard me right. The Rays game that I went to was actually very entertaining. It was also a piece of history as it was the last match where aces Jon Lester (of the Boston Red Sox) and David Price (of the TB Rays) played for their respective teams before 2014's CRAZY trade deadline.

So let's kick it off. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce you to the TAMPA BAY RAYS and TROPICANA FIELD.

The Tampa Bay Rays.

One of the youngest franchises in MLB history, Tampa's professional baseball team started off as an expansion team in 1998 as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The team's debut in the AL East is a long and storied history with back room dealings and intrigue reminiscent of a political drama but I won't get into too much detail. For those of you that are interested, I recommend reading "The Extra 2%" by Jonah Keri. The short version is that Tampa got burned multiple times in their effort to finally bring an MLB team to the city. When they finally got their wish, the organization ended up in the AL East, one of the most historic and competitive divisions in baseball. Between the Yankees and the Red Sox, who has time to root for the Tampa Bay Rays? Yet despite these setbacks, the leadership of General Manager Andrew Friedman, President Matthew Silverman, and Manager Joe Maddon, the Rays were able to make a name for themselves in 2008 and 2010, winning the Division titles with one of the smallest pay checks in MLB history. 

The 2014 Tampa Bay Rays aren't exactly the hottest team in baseball.
