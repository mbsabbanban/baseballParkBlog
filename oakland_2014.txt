Oakland Athletics at the Oakland Colisseum

Hey Readers,

To start off my new series of blog posts on baseball parks, I've decided that I would surprise everyone and start off with the not-so-obvious choice. Today I'll be talking about my experience at the Oakland Colisseum where I saw the Oakland A's play against the Texas Rangers. ( I know, I know, you're probably thinking Whattt!?!!? Not the Mets?!?!) Figured I'd start out with something new since I did do a mini-post about the Mets last year.

So I'm not sure how I'm going to do the rankings since I haven't been to an astounding number of ball parks. I will probably go with 5 categories, each of them on a 1 to 10 scale. Now I can't really control the Match-up since who knows how the game is going to be, but the other categories such as Fan Base, Park Aesthetics, Park Amenities, and lastly, Park Food & Drinks (wanted to break it out from Amenities). I will also go back after a period of time and do a re-evaluation of the all the parks and will probably write an article that re-evaluates every park. I'm hoping that with every visitation (and possibly re-visitation), my overall score for every park will change.

Alright, enough of the boring explanations, it's time to get onto the good stuff.

The Oakland Atheletics.

Founded in 1968, the Oakland A's are the hottest team in baseball right now, leading the AL West (although it looks like recently the LA Angels have been catching up) with a 51-33 record. Jesus, if they keep going at this pace they could get over a hundred wins this season. Anyways, this team is the team that was the focus of MONEYBALL and the product that we're seeing on the field right now is a testament of Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt to you non-baseball folk) ability as a General Manager.

With a salary of $75 mil for the year (the Mets are spending $82 mil), the Oakland A's have powerful offensive players like Yoenis Cespedes, Brandon Moss,and Josh Donaldson. It's not only the offense that is driving this team. They have superb pitching crew as well. Sonny Gray, Scott Kazmir, my boy Drew Pomeranz (although he is a bit of a dumbass). I could go on and on but as a Mets fan, it's something to be jealous about. After reading the book MONEYBALL, I have only the utmost respect for the Oakland A's organization and the economist in me is right on board with the management philosophy of the Oakland A's. Correct the market inefficiencies inherent in baseball. 

To put it in laymen's terms, the Oakland A's are trying to get the most bang for their buck.

And with that in mind, I walk into the O.co Colisseum.
